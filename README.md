This project explores the 2021 World Happiness Report dataset, which ranks countries based on various factors including GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, and perceptions of corruption. By employing machine learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Linear Regression, we aim to predict a countryâ€™s happiness score and output based on these indicators. This analysis provides insights into the key drivers of happiness and how different countries compare in terms of overall well-being. 
Through visualization and predictive modeling, we can better understand the relationship between economic and social metrics and global happiness levels.
